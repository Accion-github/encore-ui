<h3 class="title clear">Labels and Inputs with rxFormItem</h3>

<div class="component-description clear">
    <ul class="list">
        <li>The directive rxFormItem creates a field row wrapped in a label. Used for fields which include a single input/field.</li>
        <li>This will also apply to the textarea tag.</li>
        <li>You would most likely use this angular.js directive directly, otherwise any input field can be placed inside an element with a class of <code>field-input</code> to apply styling.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="title clear">Using a character counter on an input field</h3>

<div class="component-description clear">
    <ul class="list">
        <li>The framework provides styles for a character counter, including a generic wrapper (<code>.character-count-wrapper</code>) with the proper width needed to position the character counter in relation to a text area. Note that if you need a different text area width for specific use cases in a project, a custom wrapper class and text area width can be set.</li>
        <li>Counters are most often used with <code>textarea</code>s, where there is enough space for a user to type several sentences. It is rarely appropriate to use a counter on a different type or size input field.</li>
        <li>Character counters provide color feedback to the user in addition to numeric feedback. As a user approaches the character limit, the numeric value turns from gray to yellow, then yellow to red.</li>
        <li>See <a href="#/component/rxCharacterCount/">rxCharacterCount</a> for more specific documentation about implementing a counter on an input field.</li>

<div class="component-description clear">
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Wrapping form items in a container of class `.rx-form.layout-compressed` will affect the form elements as shown.</li>

<h3 class="title clear">Fieldsets with rxFormFieldset</h3>

<div class="component-description clear">
<ul>
    <li>The rxFormFieldset directive creates a field row wrapped in a fieldset. Used for fields which include multiple inputs (e.g. rxFormOptionTable).</li>

<h3 class="title clear">Selects with rxFormItem</h3>

<div class="component-description clear">
<ul>
    <li>The rxFormItem directive replaces the default UI of select fields and adds a custom border/arrow.</li>
    <li>You would most likely use this angular.js directive directly, if you are not using angular you could wrap the elements with <code>.field-select</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title clear">Checkboxes and radios with rxFormOptionTable</h3>

<div class="component-description clear">
<ul class="list">
    <li><a href="http://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/#/component/rxForm">rxFormOptionTable is an angularjs-based sub-directive of rxForm</a> which displays checkboxes or radio buttons on  passing in an object.</li>
    <li><span class="msg-info">ENCORE-SPECIFIC:</span> For radio buttons, while the majority of radio buttons have been used in the context of a data table, there is at least one instance in Encore where they are used as part of the label/input form combo used within rxFormItem: <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-cloud-ui/blob/master/app/views/servers/templates/server-actions.html#L112-L125">asking the user to do a hard/soft reboot</a> while in the server detail page.</li>

<h3 class="title clear">Form Validation</h3>

<div class="component-description clear">
<ul class="list">
    <li>Note: Because Encore is built in angular, we leverage the <code>ng-required</code> directive, and as a result the EncoreUI library does have a custom CSS if an element has both <code>ng-invalid</code> and <code>ng-dirty</code> classes, which are dynamically added.</li>
    <li>Designing an EncoreUI specific design pattern for form validation is on our roadmap.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="title lg" id="designpatterns">Design Patterns within Encore</h2>

<ul class="list">
    <li>Forms can be used on their own page. You can see this in Encore when you create a new object such as a <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-cloud-ui/blob/master/app/views/servers/CreateServer.html">Cloud Server</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-cloud-ui/blob/master/app/views/databases/CreateInstance.html">Database under Encore Cloud</a>.</li>
    <li>Forms are also used within modals. This can be see when modifying content that requires form fields such as <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-cloud-ui/blob/master/app/views/servers/templates/server-actions.html#L33-L72">actions performed on a server detail page</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="#/styleguide/buttons">See the section on links and buttons</a> and the <a href="#/styleguide/layouts/3">sample Create Form</a> for details about how we style and color buttons, but in a nutshell: submit buttons should use the green submit class unless you're deleting or formatting, which should be the negative class. If you need to use a button in your field for auxillary purposes, make it blue.</li>
    <li><a href="#/styleguide/basics#wells">Wells</a> can be used to create additional context for the form.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="title lg" id="roadmap">UI Roadmap / Possible Future-work</h2>

<ul class="list">
    <li>Fleshing out a design pattern for edit states. Up until now, the editing of content has been relegated to using modals to edit individual line items. As a result, different products have handled the concept of an edit state differently. There should be conformity for this, but we have not designed a user pattern yet.</li>
    <li><span class="msg-warn">HEADS UP:</span> At this time, Encore only uses stacked forms, and do not offer a design pattern for inline forms. This may change later.</li>
</ul>
